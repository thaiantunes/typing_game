# typing_game

This project was developed as a means of learning jQuery, a popular JavaScript library used for DOM manipulation and event handling. The game presents users with a passage and challenges them to type it as accurately as possible. The game features a character and word counter, as well as a timer that counts down the remaining time. The game also includes a marker feature that indicates whether the user's input matches the generated passage. Players can restart the game at any time by clicking the 'restart' button. 

Developed with:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JQuery v3.1.0 (https://jquery.com/)
- Materialize v0.97.6 (http://materializecss.com)
